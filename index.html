  <main>
    <ls>
      <p style="color:rgb(24, 57, 38)"> Recently separated from   
        active duty Army, I have decided to pursue my dream as a software engineer. 
        Before I joined the military, I had worked in E-commerce 
        and warehouses as a shipping/receiving specialist. 
        I've always strived to challenge myself and aim to achieve realistic goals. 
        Now that I have the time and the resources available to me, 
        I am commited to maximizing my potential as a student and future 
        employee in the tech industry. </p>
        
        <p style="color:brown"> I received my associates degree in culinary arts shortly after high school.
        However, I only spent a short amount of time in the food industry 
        before moving on to manual labor. When I joined the military in 2015, 
        I utilized the tools provided to gain credentials for Intelligence
        Operations Studies. I am looking forward to furthering my education through
        Code Fellows and making the most out of this opportunity! </p>
